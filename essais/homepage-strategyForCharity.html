    <h1>We're here to help small charities with their SEO and Marketing Strategies.</h1>

    <h2>You're a small charity, starting-up and trying to gain visibility and grow? We here for you.</h2>

    <p>You have two options with us : you either want to <a href="#">do it yourself</a> or you want 
      <a href="#">us to take care of your marketing and SEO</a>.</p>

    <h3>Our mission</h3>

    <p>We think charities deserve the same support and help as big ones, if not more. 
      Marketing and SEO (Search Engine Optimization) are crucial parts of getting people to know your organization.</p>

    <p>Because you're trying to change the world, we want to help you do that. 
      We want to give you the tools to engage supporters, 
      and develop a sustainable digital marketing strategy for your nonprofit</p>
